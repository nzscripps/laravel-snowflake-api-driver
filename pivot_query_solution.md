# Solution for Snowflake PIVOT Query Issue

## The Problem

When working with Snowflake's PIVOT functionality and then aggregating those results with ARRAY_AGG, there's a specific behavior related to column naming that needs to be handled carefully.

When you create a PIVOT query like:

```sql
PIVOT(SUM(diff_frac_floor) FOR beacon_id IN ('9e90t3nOfBJS3oQuFn7MzI3v0G1s','Wzlyy2fuuDSUiTmzhqIq4dGVV1QB'))
```

Snowflake creates column names that include the single quotes from the IN clause values. The resulting column names will be:
- `'9e90t3nOfBJS3oQuFn7MzI3v0G1s'` 
- `'Wzlyy2fuuDSUiTmzhqIq4dGVV1QB'`

## Issue in the Original Query

In the original query, these pivot-generated columns were being referenced without including the single quotes:

```sql
ARRAY_AGG("9e90t3nOfBJS3oQuFn7MzI3v0G1s") within group (order by DATE_CATEGORY asc) AS "9e90t3nOfBJS3oQuFn7MzI3v0G1s",
ARRAY_AGG("Wzlyy2fuuDSUiTmzhqIq4dGVV1QB") within group (order by DATE_CATEGORY asc) AS "Wzlyy2fuuDSUiTmzhqIq4dGVV1QB"
```

This caused errors because these column references didn't match the actual column names coming from the PIVOT operation.

## The Solution

When referencing columns created by a PIVOT, you must include the single quotes within the column identifier:

```sql
ARRAY_AGG("'9e90t3nOfBJS3oQuFn7MzI3v0G1s'") within group (order by DATE_CATEGORY asc) AS "9e90t3nOfBJS3oQuFn7MzI3v0G1s",
ARRAY_AGG("'Wzlyy2fuuDSUiTmzhqIq4dGVV1QB'") within group (order by DATE_CATEGORY asc) AS "Wzlyy2fuuDSUiTmzhqIq4dGVV1QB"
```

This ensures that the column names match exactly what Snowflake generates during the PIVOT operation.

## Verification

This behavior was verified through unit testing of Snowflake's column wrapping logic, which confirmed that:

1. When a column identifier includes single quotes (e.g., `"'column_name'"`), the quotes are preserved after processing.
2. This means when we reference a PIVOT-generated column, we need to include those single quotes.

## In the Context of Laravel Snowflake API Driver

This behavior is particularly important when working with the Laravel Snowflake API driver, as raw SQL statements need to reference the column names exactly as Snowflake expects them.

The issue isn't with the driver itself but with the way column names are created and referenced when using Snowflake's PIVOT functionality.
